ABOUT THE BASIC BANKING SYSTEM APP

This program is a simple banking app that allows staff to open accounts for customers and the details of the account are stored in a file customer.txt. Every staff who must use the account must have a unique user name and password details of which are entered into a text file staff.txt. Every User has the right to carry out the following tasks:

1. Create New Account with the following details:
Account Name
Opening Balance
Account Type 
Account Email
A unique 10-digit account number generated by the program automatically

2. Check Account Details
With a unique 10-digit account number generated by the program, the user can access the user’s details

Another unique feature of this program is that whenever a user successfully logs into the app, the app creates a text file named session.txt where it stores the current time of login of the user. This file is automatically deleted when the user logs out of the system.
